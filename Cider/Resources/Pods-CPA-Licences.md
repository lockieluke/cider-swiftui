      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Documentation
The main store function can handle ```set```, ```get```, ```transact```, ```setAll```, ```getAll```, ```each```, and ```clear```
actions directly. Respectively, these are called like so:

```javascript
store(key, data);                 // sets stringified data under key
store(key);                       // gets and parses data stored under key
store(key, fn[, alt]);            // run transaction function on/with data stored under key
store({key: data, key2: data2});  // sets all key/data pairs in the object
store();                          // gets all stored key/data pairs as an object
store((key, data)=>{ });          // calls function for each key/data in storage, return false to exit
store(false);                     // clears all items from storage
```

Parameters in [brackets] are optional. There are also more explicit and versatile functions available:

```javascript
store.set(key, data[, overwrite]); // === store(key, data);
store.setAll(data[, overwrite]);   // === store({key: data, key2: data});
store.get(key[, alt]);             // === store(key);
store.getAll([fillObj]);           // === store();
store.transact(key, fn[, alt]);    // === store(key, fn[, alt]);
store.clear();                     // === store(false);
store.has(key);                    // returns true or false
store.remove(key[, alt]);          // removes key and its data, then returns the data or alt, if none
store.each(fn[, fill]);            // === store(fn); optional call arg will be 3rd fn arg (e.g. for gathering values)
store.add(key, data[, replacer]);  // concats, merges, or adds new value into existing one
store.keys([fillList]);            // returns array of keys
store.size();                      // number of keys, not length of data
store.clearAll();                  // clears *ALL* areas (but still namespace sensitive)
```

Passing in ```false``` for the optional overwrite parameters will cause ```set``` actions to be skipped 
if the storage already has a value for that key. All ```set``` action methods return the previous value 
for that key, by default. If overwrite is ```false``` and there is a previous value, the unused new 
value will be returned.

Functions passed to ```transact``` will receive the current value for that key as an argument or
a passed alternate if there is none. When the passed function is completed, transact will save the returned value
under the specified key. If the function returns ```undefined```, the original value will be saved.
This makes it easy for transact functions to change internal properties in a persistent way:

```javascript
store.transact(key, function(obj) {
    obj.changed = 'newValue';// this change will be persisted
});
```

Functions passed to ```each``` will receive the key as first argument and current value as the second; if a `fill` parameter is specified, it's value will be the third argument for every call (few should ever
need a `fill` parameter). If the function returns ```false``` at any point during the iteration, the
loop will exit early and not continue on to the next key/value pair.

```javascript
store.each(function(key, value) {
    console.log(key, '->', value);
    if (key === 'stopLoop') {
        return false;// this will cause each to stop calling this function
    }
});
```

All retrieval functions which take an optional ```alt``` parameter can also use that parameter to specify a "reviver" function. These receive each key and value (yes, nested ones too) as arguments and allow you to provide an alternate means of parsing that string. This is particularly useful for rich objects like ```Date``` types. See [MDN's JSON.parse docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) for more information and examples. Alternately, you can set a global reviver to the ```store._.revive``` property to handle all ```get```, ```getAll```, ```remove```, and ```transact``` calls.

Likewise, setter functions which take an optional ```overwrite``` parameter can also use that parameter to accept a "replacer" function that receives each key and value (yes, nested ones too) as arguments and allow you to provide an alternate means of stringifying the values. This is particularly useful for rich objects like ```Date``` types. See [MDN's JSON.stringify docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) for more information and examples. Alternately, you can set a global replacer to the ```store._.replace``` property to handle all ```set```, ```setAll```, ```add```, and ```transact``` calls.

For ```getAll``` and ```keys```, there is the option to pass in the object or list, respectively,
that you want the results to be added to. This is instead of an empty list.
There are only a few special cases where you are likely to need or want this,
in general, most users should ignore these optional parameters.
These both use the  second, optional argument ```each``` function,
which is also a niche feature. The ```value``` argument is passed as
the second arg to the callback function (in place of the data associated with the current key)
and is returned at the end. Again, most users should not need this feature.
All of these use the browser's localStorage (aka "local"). Using sessionStorage merely requires 
calling the same functions on ```store.session```:

```javascript
store.session("addMeTo", "sessionStorage");
store.local({lots: 'of', data: 'altogether'});// store.local === store :)
```
There is also a store API automatically available for keeping non-persistent information,
meant only to last until page reload.
```javascript
store.page("until","reload");
```

All the specific ```get```, ```set```, etc. functions are available on ```store.session```, ```store.local```, and ```store.page```, as well as any other storage facility registered via ```store.area(name, customStorageObject)``` by an extension, where customStorageObject must implement the [Storage interface][storage]. This is how [store.old.js][old] extends store.js to support older versions of IE and Firefox.

[storage]: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#the-storage-interface

If you want to put stored data from different pages or areas f your site into separate namespaces, 
the ```store.namespace(ns)``` function is your friend:

```javascript
var cart = store.namespace('cart');
cart('total', 23.25);// stores in localStorage as 'cart.total'
console.log(store('cart.total') == cart('total'));// logs true
console.log(store.cart.getAll());// logs {total: 23.25}
cart.session('group', 'toys');// stores in sessionStorage as 'cart.group'
```

The namespace provides the same exact API as ```store``` but silently adds/removes the namespace prefix as needed.
It also makes the namespaced API accessible directly via ```store[namespace]``` (e.g. ```store.cart```) as long as it
does not conflict with an existing part of the store API.

The 'namespace' function is one of three "extra" functions that are also part of the "store API":

```javascript
store.namespace(prefix);// returns a new store API that prefixes all key-based functions
store.isFake([force]);// test or set whether localStorage/sessionStorage or an in-memory, 'fake' storage is used
```

```store.namespace``` can also take extra params to only create the namespace in the called-on storage area, and
to pass in an alternate namespace delimiter for advanced use-cases (e.g. ```store.page.namespace("subpage", true, ":")```).

If localStorage or sessionStorage are unavailable, they will be faked to prevent errors,
but data stored will NOT persist beyond the life of the current document/page. Use the 
[store.old.js][old] extension to add persistent backing for the store API in ancient browsers.

```isFake(true|false)``` is particularly useful to force use of a temporary, fake storage in testing situations,
to prevent cluttering actual storage.

## Extensions
These mostly could use further documentation and abuse...er...testing.
Contributions are welcome!
In particular, any ES6 user interested in making these [importable in ES6][es6importissue] would be appreciated.

* [store.overflow.js][overflow] - Fall back to fake storage on quota errors
* [store.cache.js][cache] - To make data expire, pass a number of seconds as the overwrite (third) param on ```set()``` calls
* [store.on.js][on] - Superior storage event handling (per key, per namespace, etc in IE9+)
* [store.array.js][array] - Easy, powerful array functions for any and all data (e.g. ```store.push(key, v1, v2)```).
* [store.dom.js][dom] - Declarative, persistent DOM element content via store.
* [store.cookie.js][cookie] - Support for a cookie as a storage area: ```store.cookie('num',1)``` to make sharing with backend easier.

#### Alpha - Either incomplete or unstable or both
* [store.quota.js][quota] - Register callbacks to handle (and even cancel) quota errors
* [store.measure.js][measure] - Experimental extension for measuring space used and available (needs work)
* [store.onlyreal.js][onlyreal] - When only fake storage is available, silently fail instead of faking it.
* [store.dot.js][dot] - Creates accessors for keys (e.g. ```store.foo == store.get('foo')```)
* [store.deep.js][deep] - Allow retrieval of properties from within stored objects (e.g. ```store.get('key.property')```)
* [store.async.js][async] - Adds ```store.async``` duplicate to each store and namespace that performs functions asynchronously and returns a Promise that resolves when complete.
* [store.cookies.js][cookies] - Support managing all cookies as a storage area with the store API (e.g. ```store.cookies.get('user')```)

#### Write Your Own Extension
To write your own extension, you can use or carefully override internal functions exposed as ```store._```.
In particular, the ```store._.fn(fnName, fn)``` method is available to automatically add your new function
to every instance of the ```store``` interface (e.g. ```store```, ```store.session```
and all existing and future namespaces). Take care using this, as it will override existing methods.
Here is a simple example:

```javascript
(function(_) {
    _.fn('falsy', function(key) {
        return !this.get(key);
    });
    _.fn('truthy', function(key) {
        return !this.falsy(key);
    });
})(store._);
```
This extension would be used like so:
```javascript
store('foo', 1);
store.falsy('foo'); // returns false

store.session('bar', 'one');
store.session.truthy('bar'); // return true;

const widgetStore = store.namespace('widget');
widgetStore.falsy('state'); // returns true
```
